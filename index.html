		<h1>Welcome</h1>
		<p>I'm Ted. You can contact me by email at theted@berkeley.edu.  I suppose I'll outline some things that interest me.</p>
		<h2>Academics</h2>
		<p>
			So I double majored in Molecular Cell Biology and Computer Science at UC Berkeley from 2011-15. I was basically a straight A(-) student.
			My 3 favorite classes by a huge margin were:
			<ul>
				<li>MCB C100A Biophysical Chemistry which used the book "The Molecules of Life: Physical and Chemical Principles" by Boyana Konforti, David Wemmer*, and John Kuriyan*</li>
				<li>Math 110 Linear Algebra which used the book "Linear Algebra Done Right" by Sheldon Axler</li>
				<li>CS 170 Algorithms which used the book "Algorithms" by Christos Papadimitriou*, Sanjoy Dasgupta, and Umesh Vazirani</li>
			</ul>
			(* = author was also a professor for the course)
		</p>
		<h2>Games</h2>
		<p>
			The first online game I was really into was RuneScape.  Even now, once every year or so, I'll check out Old School RuneScape and visit the old Tutorial Island.  
			Then I was into online tetris--Tetris Friends, Battles, T-Spins, 4-wides but stopped playing as most of the sites shut down. Been meaning to try tetr.io once I alter the default key binds.
		</p>

		<p>
			Prior to online games, I mainly played 2 physical board games: carrom and chess.  In fact, in my spare time, I'm working on an online game that is inspired by these board games.
			It's basically simplified live action chess with carrom board physics.
